# Power BI Bank Loan Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of a bank's loan data using Power BI. It includes various visualizations and interactive dashboards to understand loan distributions, trends, and other key metrics.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze bank loan data to uncover insights related to the bank’s loan portfolio, such as:

- Loan approval trends
- Distribution of loan amounts by category
- Customer demographics of borrowers
- Interest rates and payment behavior

The final report visualizes these insights and can be used by bank managers or financial analysts to make informed decisions about their loan products.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about various loan applications, including:

- Loan Amount
- Interest Rate
- Loan Term
- Customer Age
- Loan Status (Approved, Rejected)
- Customer Demographics

The data is anonymized and provided in CSV format. It includes several variables that allow for segmented analysis based on customer profiles and loan details.

## Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations:

- **Loan Approval Rate**: Displays loan approval trends over time.
- **Loan Amount Distribution**: Breaks down the loan amounts across different categories.
- **Interest Rate vs. Loan Amount**: Shows the relationship between the interest rates and loan amounts.
- **Customer Demographics**: Displays insights based on the customer’s age, gender, etc.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Maps the loan applications by region or city.
